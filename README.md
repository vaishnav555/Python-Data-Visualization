Project Title: Diwali Sale Data Analysis

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of Diwali sale data to uncover customer purchasing patterns, product performance, and key sales insights. The dataset included various attributes such as customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, and city-wise sales data. Using tools like Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I cleaned and visualized the data to identify trends such as which age group spent the most, which products performed best, and which regions saw higher sales. The analysis helped in understanding consumer behavior during the festive season and provided recommendations to improve marketing strategies and stock planning for future sales. This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and generating business insights from real-world data.
